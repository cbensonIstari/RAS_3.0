# Reusable Asset Specification (RAS) 3.0

## Overview

Welcome to **RAS 3.0**, the latest version of the Reusable Asset Specification (RAS), developed under the Object Management Group (OMG) standards. RAS 3.0 enables developers, architects, and teams to package, share, and reuse software assets efficiently, promoting consistency and accelerating development across projects and organizations.

### Key Features of RAS 3.0:
- **Improved Modularity**: Enhanced support for modular, composable assets, making it easier to integrate assets across a wider range of environments.
- **Extended Metadata**: New fields in asset metadata to support modern software ecosystems, including cloud, containerization, and microservices.
- **Flexible Packaging**: Advanced packaging formats for multiple distribution methods (e.g., cloud repositories, Git, artifact management systems).
- **Compliance and Security**: Enhanced support for compliance and security tagging, enabling better integration with secure software supply chains.
- **Backward Compatibility**: RAS 3.0 remains compatible with previous versions of the specification, ensuring smooth migration and reuse of existing assets.

## Introduction

RAS 3.0 provides a standardized way to create reusable assets that can be shared across different systems, tools, and development environments. By packaging assets with detailed metadata, RAS ensures that assets are easily discoverable, portable, and integrable.

This repository contains the full specification of RAS 3.0, along with examples, guidelines, and tooling to help you get started with creating and using reusable assets.

## Getting Started

### Requirements:
- A development environment supporting RAS-compliant tools (e.g., UML, BPMN editors, IDEs).

### Installation:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/ras-3.0.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd ras-3.0
    ```

3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
    ```bash
    npm install / pip install
    ```

4. Start using the provided RAS tooling and examples to create your first reusable asset.

## Asset Structure

An asset in RAS 3.0 is packaged as a structured directory containing the following:

```bash
├── asset-name/
│   ├── artifacts/         # Main reusable components (e.g., code, models, templates)
│   ├── metadata/          # Metadata file describing the asset (required fields listed below)
│   ├── docs/              # Optional documentation about the asset's usage
│   ├── examples/          # Examples or sample usage of the asset (if applicable)
│   └── licenses/          # License information (e.g., open source, proprietary)
