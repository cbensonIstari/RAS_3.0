# Reusable Asset Specification (RAS) 3.0 - Repository

Welcome to the **Reusable Asset Specification (RAS) 3.0** repository. This repository is a collection of relevant specifications, reference documents, and proposed modifications related to the ongoing development and refinement of the Reusable Asset Specification (RAS) under the **Object Management Group (OMG)** framework. The goal of this repository is to facilitate collaboration, track changes, and maintain historical records of various assets.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Proposed_RAS3.0_Spec**
- **Required_Base.csv**: This file includes the fundamental requirements for the proposed RAS 3.0 specification. It serves as the foundational checklist for building out the reusable asset framework.

### 2. **Reference Specs**
   This folder contains various important reference materials that provide context and precedence for the current work on RAS 3.0.
   
   - **DoD DSM (2020)**
     - **DoD_Digital_System_Model_Data_Taxonomy.pdf**: This PDF outlines the U.S. Department of Defense's Digital System Model (DSM) Data Taxonomy, a key reference for aligning the RAS with military digital systems.
     - **DoD_DSM_Page1_Only.csv**: This CSV file contains metadata related to the first page of the DSM taxonomy, useful for understanding key data structures.

   - **MSC-DMS (2012)**
     - **Modeling_and_Simulation_Col_Discovery_Framework.pdf**: This PDF explains the MSC-DMS discovery framework for modeling and simulation collaboration.
     - **MSC-DMS_Reusable_Asset_Group_Survey.csv**: This CSV provides a survey of reusable asset groups identified under the MSC-DMS initiative, laying the groundwork for asset categorization.

   - **RAS_2.0_2005**
     - **RAS_assets.csv**: This CSV contains a list of assets from the 2005 RAS 2.0 specification.
     - **RAS_UML_2.0_formal-05-11-02.pdf**: The formal OMG specification for RAS 2.0, which provides context for the evolution to RAS 3.0.

   - **W3 Data Catalog (DCAT)**
     - **Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT).pdf**: The PDF of the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary standard, which is critical for integrating data catalog principles into the reusable asset specification.
     - **DCAT_Survey_Template_for_OMG_Reusable_Asset_Survey.xlsx**: This template is intended for surveying reusable assets, leveraging the DCAT model as a foundational structure.

### 3. **README.md**
- This README file that provides an overview of the repository structure and guidance on how to use the contents.
